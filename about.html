          <p>I spent the last 12 years developing my skills as a project manager for the U.S. military, where I won several performance awards and was promoted seven times before being honorably discharged. I love managing teams and working with
      stakeholders. In this role, I managed high-performance teams with four to eight members. I also led events with 300 employees and 2000 guests, which involved several government agencies and departments. These events required effective
      communication, scheduling, planning, and leveraging of technology to drive progress. The management skills and technology experience gained during these projects make me a qualified and skilled leader.</p>

          <p>Although I enjoyed my time in uniform, supporting and defending the constitution of the United States, I desired to look for career and growth opportunities in the private sector. At this stage of my career, I feel ready to apply myself to new
      challenges. I am very interested in IT, software development, and software security companies. So, after leaving the military, I have returned to the universities seeking the degrees and certificates necessary for this career journey. For the
      past two years, I have been a full-time student at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, working on a Master of Science in Project Management degree. I am due to graduate in March 2023. I have received the Google Project Management: Professional
      Certificate offered through Coursera. My next certification goal is the PMP certification, offered through the Project Management Institute (PMI), of which I am a member.</p>
